# DAP

A friendly pseudocode that I implemented, inspired by my university professor, Mr. Jimmy. To prove that I can be like him. One day.

## Example code:

```javascript
program ThisIsAProgram
dictionary
    n : integer
algorithm
    n <- 1

    for i = 1 to 10 do
        n <- n * i
    endfor

    print n
endprogram
```
